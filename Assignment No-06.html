<h2> Inspiring Quotas:-</h2>
<p> Dreams don’t have to just be dreams. You can make it a reality;
 if you just keep pushing and keep trying,
 then eventually you’ll reach your goal. And if that takes a few years, then that’s great, 
but if it takes 10 or 20, then that’s part of the process.
</p>
<h3 style ="color:red;">
 Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you. <br>
 Nothing is impossible. The word itself says ‘I’m possible!
</h3>
<h4>
1} Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.<br>
2} Just don’t give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there is love and inspiration, I don’t think you can go wrong.
</h4>
<h5>
3} Nobody built like you, you design yourself.<br>
4} Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
